 	so you want to learn more about the wonderful beans? beware this is a very complicated topic, and does not come easily to evreyone. beans are fruits that are good for your health. there are lots of diffrent types of beans in the world, and they all have their own purpose. i have decided to comit my life to the bean known as the "jelly bean". although most people know it by this name its scientific name is Sedum rubrotinctum.The first jelly bean was created in the 1800s by an unknown American candy maker. A 1861 advertisement recommended sending jelly beans to soldiers fighting in the Civil War. The eight original flavors or Jelly Belly beans introduced in 1976 were Root Beer, Very Cherry, Cream Soda, Green Apple, Grape, Lemon, Licorice, and Tangerine. Very Cherry was the most popular flavor of Jelly Belly beans for 20 years until 1998, when Buttered Popcorn moved to the top of the charts. But, in 2003 Very Cherry moved back into first by a mere 8 million beans. There were enough Jelly Belly beans consumed last year to circle the earth over 5 times.President Ronald Reagan used Jelly beans for many things, he even had a flavor made for him. There is a portrait of President Ronald Reagan made from 10,000 Jelly Belly beans that hangs in the Ronald Reagan Presidentident. it was first invented in the 17th century, in France to make Jordan Almonds. Today the panning process is done by a machine but, it has remained essentially the same since the last 300 years. The french would start by rocking the almonds in a bowl of sugar and syrup until the almonds were completely coated in a candy shell, basicly what they do to make jelly beans. Today though, large rotating pans do the hard work, while master confectioners apply their true art in adding just the right ingredients to create the perfect, smooth shell for the beans. Somehow the two processes made their way into America.
